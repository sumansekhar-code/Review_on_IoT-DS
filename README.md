This paper summarizes the foremost use or implementation of IoT(Internet of Things) and how it will relate with Data Science in real life problem. 
Today world transferring from conventional to Hi-Tech or digital world with the automations. All most all the things are done by machines which are 
automatically operated and generated data those are helpful to get the insight of data related to the economy and growth of business or any organizations.

The phrase data science has become popular among social media apps all across the world. The related device known as IoT creates more than 2.5 quintillion 
bytes of statistics per second, which may have a significant influence on company processes. Without a doubt, the emerging technology of IoE (Internet of Everything) 
is reliant on the Data Science idea. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which accounts for a significant fraction of IoT, attempts to 
evaluate the data it collects and convert it into valuable information. With traditional Data Science, the inquiry is static and limited in scope. 
Since the information obtained may not be up to date, the results achieved during training may be shrewd or useful. Yet, since IoT data is always being collected, 
the investigation supplements the most current market designs, allowing this investigation to be more important and wiser when compared to conventional ones. 
Moreover, when additional innovation layers are added to or integrated with IoT, it becomes increasingly difficult to organize and interpret the massive 
amounts of incoming data. As a result, Data Scientists must improve their skills in order to comprehend IoT-generated data. As the engaging quality of 
IoT grows, a stream of information awaits. It is sure to transform the way Data Science has been perceived for quite some time. The information explosion 
will need not just stronger foundations, but also more smart Data Scientists. Information Science for IoT may assist in overcoming some significant 
challenges in order to make more accurate decisions. This study aims to help readers identify the efficient use of data science in IOT platforms in 
the approaching era as IoT Possibilities for Data Science in a safe way.

Analyzing data to provide useful conclusions for a company is the focus of DS. It is a method for analyzing massive datasets that draws from several 
disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of "things" (inanimate items) 
equipped with electronics (such as sensors and software) that can communicate with one another and with other devices and systems through the internet. 
What we mean when we say "data science" is the study of methods that allow us to get insight from data. Data, when discussing the Internet of Things, 
refers to information gathered by sensors, devices, apps, and other smart devices. On the other hand, the data's worth is determined by how well it can 
foretell future developments and consequences. The Data Science Process is an agile method for delivering analytics solutions and innovative applications. 
Methods of data processing are discussed in the following sections. Preparing the Data: It's a method for cleaning up data sets from their original form. 
Raw data format acquired from numerous sources is not practical for analysis. The method was implemented by data scientists to make the data more useful 
for their purposes. The process of data pre-processing involves a few elementary actions, including	
•	Data cleaning	
•	Data Integration	
•	Data Transformation	
•	Data Reduction	
•	Data discretization
